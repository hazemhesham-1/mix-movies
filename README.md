# Mix Movies

Mix Movies is a react application that provides users with a way to explore movies, rate them, and manage their watched movies list. By using OMDB API (Open Movie Database), the app gains access to an extensive movie database, allowing users to quickly and easily find movie information, including genre, cast, director, ratings, and much more.

## Features

- **Search Bar**: Users can search for movies using keywords.

- **Movie Details**: Users can select a specific movie to view its IMDb rating, runtime, and other details.
- **User Ratings**: Users have the ability to rate movies they have watched.
- **Watchlist**: Users can create a personal watchlist of movies they plan to watch or have already watched.
- **User Statistics**: The application displays the users average rating, the number of movies they have rated, and the number of movies they have watched.
